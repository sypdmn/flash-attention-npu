## Introduction

FlashAttention significantly improves training and inference efficiency for modern large language models through tiling and memory-aware algorithms. The current mainstream implementation is [Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), which is primarily designed for NVIDIA GPU architectures. During Ascend platform migration, we found the lack of an API-compatible implementation with [Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) increased adaptation complexity. To address this gap, this repository implements FlashAttention algorithms adapted for Ascend NPU by following the core design of [Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) and building upon the [CANN/CATLASS](https://gitcode.com/cann/catlass) framework and its sample code. We provide an API consistent with [Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) to facilitate model migration and enable future attention algorithm optimizations for Ascend NPU.

**This project is under active development, and discussions and contributions are highly welcome.**

## Usage

### FlashAttention v2

#### flash_attn_with_kvcache

```python
def flash_attn_with_kvcache(
    q,
    k_cache,
    v_cache,
    k=None,
    v=None,
    rotary_cos=None,
    rotary_sin=None,
    cache_seqlens: Optional[Union[(int, torch.Tensor)]] = None,
    cache_batch_idx: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None,
    block_table: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None,
    softmax_scale=None,
    causal=False,
    window_size=(-1, -1),  # -1 means infinite context window
    rotary_interleaved=True,
    alibi_slopes=None,
):
    """
    If k and v are not None, k_cache and v_cache will be updated *in-place* with the new values
    from k and v. This is useful for incremental decoding: you can pass in the cached key/value
    from the previous step, update them with the new key/value from the current step, and in
    the same kernel perform attention with the updated cache.

    If you pass in k / v, you must make sure that the cache is large enough to hold the new values.
    For example, the KV cache can be pre-allocated with the max sequence length, and you can use
    cache_seqlens to keep track of the current sequence length for each sequence in the batch.

    If rotary_cos and rotary_sin are passed in, rotary positional embedding will be applied.
    key @k will be rotated by rotary_cos and rotary_sin at positions cache_seqlens, cache_seqlens + 1, etc.
    If causal or local (i.e., window_size != (-1, -1)), query @q will be rotated at positions
    cache_seqlens, cache_seqlens + 1, etc.
    If neither causal nor local, query @q will be rotated only at position cache_seqlens
    (i.e., we assume that all tokens in @q are at position cache_seqlens).

    Multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA) are supported by passing in fewer KV heads
    than Q heads. Q head count must be divisible by KV head count.
    For example, if Q has 6 heads and K, V have 2 heads, then Q heads 0, 1, 2 will attend to
    K, V head 0, and Q heads 3, 4, 5 will attend to K, V head 1.

    If causal=True, the causal mask is aligned to the bottom-right corner of the attention matrix.
    For example, if seqlen_q = 2 and seqlen_k = 5, the causal mask (1 = keep, 0 = mask) is:
        1 1 1 1 0
        1 1 1 1 1
    If seqlen_q = 5 and seqlen_k = 2, the causal mask is:
        0 0
        0 0
        0 0
        1 0
        1 1
    If a row of the mask is all zeros, the output will be zero.

    If window_size != (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.
    Query at position i will only attend to keys in [i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - window_size[0],
    i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q + window_size[1]].

            If False, rotary positional embedding combines dimensions 0 & rotary_dim / 2,
            1 & rotary_dim / 2 + 1 (i.e., GPT-NeoX style).

    FlashAttention for variable-length sequences with optional paged KV cache.

    If cu_seqlens_q is provided, the input is treated as varlen (packed) format,
    where all sequences are concatenated along the sequence dimension. Otherwise,
    q, k, v are treated as dense tensors of shape (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim).

    For paged KV cache, pass page_table and shape k/v as
    (num_pages, page_size, nheads_k, headdim).

    Supports multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA) by passing in KV with fewer heads
    than Q. The number of heads in Q must be divisible by the number of heads in KV.

    If causal=True, the causal mask is aligned to the bottom right corner of the attention matrix.
    For example, if seqlen_q = 2 and seqlen_k = 5, the causal mask (1 = keep, 0 = masked out) is:
        1 1 1 1 0
        1 1 1 1 1

        0 0
        0 0
        0 0
        1 0
        1 1
    If the row of the mask is all zero, the output will be zero.

    If window_size != (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Query at position i
    will only attend to keys between
    [i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - window_size[0], i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q + window_size[1]] inclusive.

        page_table [optional]: (batch_size, max_num_pages_per_seq), dtype torch.int32. Page table
